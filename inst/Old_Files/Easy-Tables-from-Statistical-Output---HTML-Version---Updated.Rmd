# Making tables from Statistical Output

Copying and pasting statistical output is time-consuming
and prone to errors.  When multiple analyses need to be run,
it's even worse.

R has multiple ways to extract organized statistical ouput into data frames or tables. At that point the information is easily understood 
and renderable in documents and presentations.

 This presentation will cover {.flexbox .vcenter}

*   The nature of R statistical output and how to explore it
and extract items 'by hand'.

*   How to use the **xtable** pacakge to extract and organize output.<p>

*   How to use the **broom** package to clean and tidy output.<p>




# Data - bodyfat.sav:

*   This presentation will use the 'BodyFat' data set built used as a sample set for SPSS (available at http://calcnet.mth.cmich.edu/org/spss/prjs_datasets.htm )



```{r load-bodyfat-data-set, echo = TRUE}

bodyfat_df <- read_sav(here("inst/extdata/bodyfat.sav"))

```

## Body Fat Data Set:

```{r print-bodyfat-data-set, echo = TRUE}

print(bodyfat_df)

```


# Basic Structure of Output


 - Assign the output of a model to an object.
 - Use 'class()' to find out the class of the output object (you can then google it)
 - Use the 'names()' function to find the names of the major components of the object.
 - Use the 'str()' to get a breakdown of the object's components

## Simple Linear Model

Typing the object's name gives some basic information.

```{r run-lm, echo =TRUE}

lm1 <- lm(y ~ x1, data= bodyfat_df)

```


```{r print-lm, echo =TRUE}

lm1 


```



```{r class-lm, echo =TRUE}

class(lm1)

```


```{r names-lm, echo =TRUE}

names(lm1)

```


```{r str-lm, echo =TRUE}

str(lm1)

```


You can extract the parts of the object, examine them and then use them:

```{r print-coefficients-lm}

lm1$coefficients

```


```{r structure-coefficients-lm}

names(lm1$coefficients)
str(lm1$coefficients)


```


```{r extract-coefficients-lm}

class(lm1$coefficients)
dim(lm1$coefficients)
length(lm1$coefficients)
lm1$coefficients[1]
lm1$coefficients[2]

```


You can also use the summary - this will print out different information
depending on the class of the object:


```{r summary-lm, echo =TRUE}

summary(lm1) 

```


By examining the structure of the summary you can get another view of the object:


```{r str-summary-lm, echo =TRUE}

str(summary(lm1) )

```
At this point you can attempt to access the coefficients *and* the std. errors:

```{r coefficients-standard-errors-lm1, echo =TRUE}

summary_coefficients <- summary(lm1)$coefficients
class(summary_coefficients)

```

Once you can refer to these values, you can now use these values in text:

```{r use-values-in-text, echo =TRUE}

# The estimated effect of X1 is: `r round(summary_coefficients[2,1],2)`; 
# standard error is: `r round(summary_coefficients[2,2],2)`.

```

The estimated effect of X1 is: `r round(summary_coefficients[2,1],2)`; 
standard error is: `r round(summary_coefficients[2,2],2)`.

And so on.  

You could also run chunks through kable, to get a nice looking table for use in 
papers or presentations:

```{r, echo =TRUE, eval=TRUE}

summary_coefficients %>% 
  as.data.frame() %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(across(where(is.numeric), round,2)) %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = 
                  c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive",
                    full_width = F, position = "center")
  ) 

```


<h2>** Problem:  **</h2>

This can be tedious, and has to be redone for each different model or analysis.
It does give you custom results, but at the usual cost. What alternatives are there?


# The xtable Package:

*   The xtable package was designed to produce latex tables for export.

*   It can also produce html tables.

*   The xtable package generates tables from various objects, well-formatted for 
use in papers and presentations.

*   xtable will examine the input object, and format it as needed.  

*   Objects created by xtable can be exported, to be used in other applications/
documents.

*   They can be brought back in from those external files.



```{r xtable-bodyfat_df, echo = TRUE}

xtable1 <- xtable(bodyfat_df)

print(xtable1, type="html", file="xtable1.html")
print(xtable1, type="latex", file="xtable1.tex")


```


```{r include-xtable1, echo=TRUE}

htmltools::includeHTML("xtable1.html")

```

## Other examples:

```{r xtable-lm2, echo=TRUE}
lm2 <- aov(y ~ x1 + x2 + x3 , data = bodyfat_df)

summary(lm2)
print(lm2)
print(xtable(lm2), type = "html", file = "lm2.html")

```


```{r insert-xtable-lm2,echo=TRUE}

htmltools::includeHTML("lm2.html")

```


You can also improve the formatting (the default format is bad):


```{r format-xtable, echo=TRUE}

xtable_lm2 <- xtable(lm2)

# align(xtable_lm2) <- xalign(xtable_lm2)
# digits(xtable_lm2) <- xdigits(xtable_lm2)
# display(xtable_lm2) <- xdisplay(xtable_lm2)

autoformat(xtable_lm2)

print(xtable_lm2, type = "html")

print(xtable_lm2, type = "html", file = "xtable_lm2.html")


```




```{r insert-xtable_lm2,echo=TRUE}

htmltools::includeHTML("xtable_lm2.html")

```


# The Broom Package

The broom package is part of the tidymodels package.
The goal is to convert output into tidy data frames for easy manipulation 

It has 3 main functions:

*   tidy() summarizes information about model components
*   glance() reports information about the entire model
*   augment() adds informations about observations back to a data set,
usually the one used in the model, such as Cook's distance, fitted values,
residuals, etc.


## tidy()

The tidy() function takes the output object and collects the components 
into a data frame/tibble:

This the raw lm() object:

```{r tidy-lm2,echo=TRUE }

tidy_lm2 <- broom::tidy(lm2)

lm2

```

This is the tidied lm() object:

```{r print-tidy-lm2,echo=TRUE }

tidy_lm2

```

Since this is a tibble (enhanced data frame), you can treat this like any 
other data frame, using dply to manipulate it, or rendering it with kable():

```{r render-tidy-lm2,echo=TRUE }

tidy_lm2 %>% 
   dplyr::mutate(across(where(is.numeric), round,2)) %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = 
                  c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive",
                    full_width = F, position = "center")
  ) 

```

## glance()

glance() collects various statistics from the lm() object into a data frame (tibble).
Again, this can be manipulated with all of the regular r tools.

```{r glance-lm2,echo=TRUE }

glance_lm2 <- broom::glance(lm2)

glance_lm2



```


```{r render-glance-lm2,echo=TRUE }

glance_lm2 <- broom::glance(lm2)

glance_lm2 %>% 
   dplyr::mutate(across(where(is.numeric), round,3)) %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = 
                  c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive",
                    full_width = F, position = "center")
  ) 


```
## augment()

augment() 

```{r augment-lm2,echo=TRUE }

augment_lm2 <- broom::augment(lm2, bodyfat_df)

head(augment_lm2)




```
